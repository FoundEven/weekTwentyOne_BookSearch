# weekTwentyOne_BookSearch

## Description

My motivation for creating this project was to create a way to search and save my favorite books. I made this project learn more about react and graphql to improve my skills at creating websites that use frontend and backend. This solves the problem of having to find my favorite books and store the data about the book by hand. I learned from this project was how graphql is used to create websites.
